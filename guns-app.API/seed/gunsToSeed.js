The 'M9' is the main sidearm of Sergeant Paul Jackson and many other Marines and enemies, though an MEU(SOC) pistol would be more accurate to see in use by the Marines as they are part of the 1st Reconnaissance Battalion; this is somewhat fixed in the 'Shock and Awe' level, where Jackson's secondary weapon is an M1911 variant. In-game, the 92SB has the same damage figures as the USP and the 1911, but has the least effective range. This is offset with the highest magazine capacity (fifteen rounds of 9mm) and the lowest recoil, allowing quick follow up shots. It can be suppressed.",

Its recoil, capacity, and stopping power make this gun the most balanced in its class.It appears that at some stage in design this weapon was going to be a Heckler & Koch Mark 23 rather than a USP; it mounts the prototype Mark 23 LAM, and has a visible projecting barrel in both first and third person modes which would not be present on a standard USP45. Interestingly, the Modern Warfare 2 USP45 model also has the rear sights of a Mark 23 even though this version does not, most likely due to recycling parts of the scrapped Mark 23 model.",

Its sole 'special' appearance in singleplayer is in the 1996 mission 'All Ghillied Up' with suppressor and red dot sight, and in this case it is anachronistic; while the original P90 was available during that time, the TR variant was introduced three years later.The P90 deals relatively low damage per shot and has a mediocre accuracy, relying on a high rate of fire and its large fifty-round magazine capacity for its effectiveness. The weapon is easy to wield in multiplayer, so much so that it has been restricted in competitive play due to its 'spray' advantage over other weapons.",

Its high short-range damage, lack of recoil, and extreme rate of fire make it effective up close, balanced by a slow reload, low capacity (twenty .32 ACP rounds), and weak long-range damage. The weapon also has very little muzzle climb. Due to an early bug in multiplayer, where its damage did not decrease when silenced, the weapon has been banned from all major competitive leagues. The ban is likely for its ability to cause fifty damage at close range (half the regular health, 1/4th of the damage in Old School, and kills in one shot on Hardcore).",

                description: "The Benelli M4 Super 90 appears as the 'M1014.' It has a higher rate of fire than the W1200, but a lower magazine capacity (in multiplayer) and, like the W1200, a slow reload time. It is used by some Marines and by Soap MacTavish in 'Safehouse.'' The player never cocks the weapon on an empty reload, which would mean that a round isn't chambered and the gun couldn't fire. The weapon holds 7 rounds in singleplayer, but only 4 in multiplayer.This was also the only semi-automatic weapon, prior to a post-release patch, and in the remaster, to not have a ridiculous maximum rate of fire, as it's capped at 300 rounds a minute, as opposed to the 1200 RPM exhibited by the other semi-auto weapons. Said patch also dropped the max ROF for the G3 and M14 down to 444 RPM due to these two weapons being ripe for exploit with modded controllers (or, on PC, the classic trick of binding 'fire' to the mouse scroll wheel).",

The version in-game has bakelite magazines, which led to some to believe it actually was a 74; the curve of the magazine and grooves on the magwell give away that it is based on a 47.In the campaign, it is mostly seen in the hands of Al-Asad's Middle East forces, and has a slower rate of fire than in multiplayer. One with a GP-30 is seen in the S.A.S. armory. While it handles like the other SMGs and its damage is equivalent to the H&K MP5, the AK-74u penetrates walls and other cover like the other assault rifles, a trait it does not share with the other SMGs, though in return its sights also have more pronounced idle sway like an assault rifle.

Whereas the real Colt Sporter Competition is semi-automatic only, the 'M16A4' in the game is fully-automatic in single player (like an M16A3), while in multiplayer it fires in three-round burst mode (which would be correct for an actual M16A4). This makes an on-target salvo from the rifle very effective, but also makes misses much more costly, especially in close-quarters when pitted against full-auto weapons. Optics mounted on the rifle remove the front sight and gas block, which would render the gun unable to cycle automatically after the first shot, and the shooter would have to manually rack the bolt to load the next round into the chamber, effectively making the gun bolt-action. By default, it is fitted with a KAC M5 railed handguard like a real M16A4 (albeit without the cutout at the front for mounting an M203), but this only occurs in first person; the third-person model appears with the standard M16A2-style handguard instead.

Much is made of the supposedly realistic ballistics in "One Shot, One Kill;" a long list of factors affecting the shot is given, but the only two actually accounted for are bullet drop due to range and deflection due to wind; the weapon does fire modelled projectiles in this sequence rather than using hitscans. The actual purpose of the long-range shot is rather less than realistic; the first shot the player fires which intersects Zakhaev's hitbox will always curve and hit his arm no matter where it was aimed, while all subsequent shots, regardless of aim, will curve away and miss him. This odd "force field" is later seen again when the player is tasked with firing RPGs at a Mi-24 Hind with Zakhaev in it, and they will always curve away from it to miss.`,

It also appears in the hands of one of Zakhaev's bodyguards in the final scene. It has a higher rate of fire in single player than in multiplayer. It fires 7.62x51mm rounds from a hundred-round belt box. It is the strongest machine gun, but it suffers from damage drop-off at long ranges and also takes almost ten seconds to reload. This gun is one of the six weapons in the original multiplayer that can have a gold finish.`,

A direct-attack mode Javelin can be found near the missile silos on "All In." In both modes the Javelin is shown firing at impossibly short range: it climbs practically vertically rather than at a steep diagonal, and should not be able to hit targets closer than 160m in indirect mode or 65m in direct mode.`,

                While the Stinger has yet to acquire the later-series ability to generate digital targeting boxes with its iron sights, it is still very inaccurately portrayed: the player character does not insert a BCU into the weapon before firing (something which is needed to give a 45-second window when the weapon can actually be fired) meaning it is apparently powered by some kind of integral perpetual battery and thermodynamics-reversing unit, and the missile is shown as seeking straight out of the tube rather than flying in a straight line for 660 feet before it can track anything.`,

Stun Grenades slow down players in the blast radius greatly and causes mild visual disruption. Flash Grenades fully blind players and merely prevents sprinting instead of slowing down all movement. In multiplayer, a player can select either a flashbang or a stun grenade as special grenades, and carry three with a perk. Flashbangs have a green stripe, while Stun Grenades have a red stripe.`,
